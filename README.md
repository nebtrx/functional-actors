# functional-actors

This repo aims to implement, for fun,  a really light approach of pure 
functional actors model on top of [fs2 queues](https://fs2.io/concurrency-primitives.html) 
and [cats-effects](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect). 

Highly inspired by [scalaz-actors](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz-actors) 
and [this](https://github.com/vlovgr/actors-cats-effect-fs2), it all started
after [Scalaz 8 vs Akka Actors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eihz7kqn6mU) 
by [John A. De Goes](https://twitter.com/jdegoes)'s presentation took place.
